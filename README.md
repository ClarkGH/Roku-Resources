Resources for Roku Development

## What is this?
Notes and test files of junk code explaining what I need for Roku programming and everything in between are and do. This way I can have all of this knowledge available at all times on Github.

Roku is programmed with the [Brightscript language](https://github.com/ClarkGH/OrganizedJS). There's an additional [Brighterscript superset](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript) that adds additional functionality and usability. 

I need a Roku device before I can program in Brightscript, but that doesn't mean I can't start learning.
